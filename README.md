# Data Analytics Capstone Project

> _A comprehensive data analysis project conducted as part of a Data Analytics Bootcamp._

## Veterans Acute Care Facility Performance
_This capstone explores the perfomance of VA Acute Care Facilities in comparison to civilian hospitals in the US in terms on performance. Performance here is decided by Patient Satisfaction Survey ratings, Readmission rates, and facility area density._

## Project Overview

VA facilities exist as a service connected option for veterans to seek healthcare services. This is commonly a first option for many veterans who have VA benefits. I was curious to see how these facilities compare to the rest of the nation's healthcare facilities. 
- Are veterans more or less satisfied with their healthcare experience compared to the national average?
- How effective are the VA facilities at preventing readmission or complications compared to the national average?
- Are there regions of the country which lack VA facilities in the face of demand?

## Key Findings

Through data exploration and visualization, the conclusion made is that VA facilities perform better than civilian facilities in terms of patient ratings. Readmission rates are about the same as the national average. Interestingly, the Southern area of the US tends to rate lower overall compared to the rest of the VA facilities in other regions. This may be due to less VA facility density in the area, and increase in demand due to population increase.
